/*Emma wants to gift a bouquet to her father on his birthday and asks for help from her mother 
Rosy.Rosy gives N flower sticks numbered 1 to N to Emma and tells her to arrange it in the 
bouquet in a particular order.She asks her to arrange the first K flower sticks in an order 
of their increasing length and the remaining sticks in an order of their dereasing length.
Write an algorithm to find the final arrangement of the flower sticks in which Emma gifted 
the bouquet to her father.
 
 Input:
 8 
 3 
 7 9 4 3 45 76 1 2  
 Output:
 1 2 3 76 45 9 7 4 
 
 Input format:
 The input to the function/method consists of three aguments num,an integer representing the 
 number of flower sticks(N) random ,an integer representing the number K given by the 
 Rosy to Emma sticks,a list of integers representing the length of the flower sticks.
 Output format:
 Return a list of integers representing the finalpattern of the flower sticks in 
 which Emma gift the bouquet to her father.
